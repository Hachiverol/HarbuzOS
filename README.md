# HarbuzOS
Meta-distribution based on Arch Linux

This project will probably never become anything big enough to even be considered a meta-distribution.
I'm calling it that anyways.

To Do list:
1. Stage 1 script (base system) [DONE]
2. Stage 2 script (general setttings) [DONE]
3. Stage 3 script(s) (different variations, a.k.a. RICES) [work in progress]

The goal for now is to make a proper format to support everything, be as flexible as possible and automate the entire arch install process.
The first Stage 3 script will be based off of my current 14 Feb 2021 install.
